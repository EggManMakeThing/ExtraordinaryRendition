Note: 

I did not ask President Matt Damon for permission, nor am I in contact with him, nor do I intend to be. I have no personal hostility towards PMD and regard his work as elegant. This fork is based upon a TNP version with Unlicense, which was released unencumbered to the public domain. 

I have no present connection with any other fork of TNP, or any other dialog library.
